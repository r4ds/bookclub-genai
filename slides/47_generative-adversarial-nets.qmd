## Definition

* "Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that is designed to generate content, including text, images, video and music. It uses large language models and algorithms to analyze patterns in datasets to mimic the style or structure of specific types of content."

## GAN Objectives

* the goal of a generator is to create better fake images
* the goal of a discriminator is to better classify fake images
