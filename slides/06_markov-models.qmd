# Learning objectives

::: nonincremental
- Discuss the Markov Property
- Introduce MCMC
:::

::: notes
should talk about this before chapter 5 (reinforcement learning)

## Trajectories

> a, sausage, entered, into, a, partnership, and, set

> bird, a, and, set, up, house, together

## Markov Property

The future of a stochastic process is independent of its past

$$P(X_{t+1} = x|X_{t}, X_{t-1}, ..., X_{t-k}) = P(X_{t+1} = x|X_{t})$$
* memoryless property
